# Code/Full_systems/Selfies_Mol/Featurization

This folder contains the code necessary to vectorize (featurize) the SELFIES representation of the molecules.

## Files:

- `selfies_featurization_one_hot.ipynb` is used to generate the one-hot encoding of the SELFIES representation. This is necessary to train the models. **It is important to run it before training the models.**

- `selfies_group_dict.json` contains the encoding index of the SELFIES parts. It is generated by the `selfies_featurization_one_hot.ipynb` notebook or you can also manually create it.
