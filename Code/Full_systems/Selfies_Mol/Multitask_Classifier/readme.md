# Code/Full_systems/Selfies_Mol/Multitask_Classifier folder

This folder contains the code necessary to train the multitask classifier model.

## Files:

- `SELFIES_multitask_tuner.ipynb` is used to (tune,) train and evaluate the multitask classifier model. The generated models are saved in the `Models` folder.

- `SELFIES_multitask.ipynb` is an experimental notebook. It is a playground to test the model training and evaluation. Feel free to play around with it.
